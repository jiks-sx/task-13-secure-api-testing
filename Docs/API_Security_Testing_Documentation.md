# Secure API Testing & Authorization Validation – Documentation

## Introduction
APIs enable communication between applications using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Improper authentication or authorization checks can allow attackers to access sensitive resources.

## API Authentication
Authentication verifies user identity using:
- API keys
- Tokens (JWT)
- OAuth
- Session cookies

## Authorization
Authorization determines what resources a user can access after authentication. Broken authorization allows users to access data belonging to other users.

## Common API Security Risks
- Broken authentication
- Broken authorization
- Lack of rate limiting
- Improper input validation
- Information disclosure

## Importance of API Security Testing
Testing ensures APIs enforce authentication, authorization, and proper input validation to prevent unauthorized access.
